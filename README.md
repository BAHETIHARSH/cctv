<h1>Use Python to Build Home Security Camera</h1>
<br>
<h2>Inspiration for this build</h2>
The idea for this particular build started with a spate of package thefts in my neighborhood. I researched various WiFi enabled home security cameras, the average cost of which usually floated in the $100 to $200 range. Since I had a basic knowledge of Python already on hand, I decided to try building my own.
